 This is a connect four game Assignment given by Coditation.
 
 .In this connect four game first we fix the size of the column-7, and size of the row- 6.
 . After that we created a class board with method which is used to make the connect four game.

            2. which_turn -> this method decide turn of the player
            3. in_bounds  -> this method check the boundary of the game
